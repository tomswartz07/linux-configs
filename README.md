Linux Configuation 'DotFiles'
============================
About the code
--------------
This repository contains all of the 'dot files' related to my 
ideal Linux setup, allowing me to quickly and easily set up a 
new system to my preferences.

Anyone is free and welcome to use my files as examples for their setup.

Using the code
--------------
Clone the repository and unpack the various .files to the appropriate location

I have included a file `metadata.common` to help map the default locations for each dotfile.

The vast majority of the files should be stored in the `$HOME` folder.
